Explain the game – 
BlackJack – 
Hit - You ask for an extra card.
Stay - You are content with your score.
Bust - You went over the score of 21; you lose your bet.
Round Play: You are only playing against the Dealer. This means that as long as you have more than the Dealer's final score without busting, you win. The Dealer is required to hit until it gets to 17 or above. Each player can chose to Hit or Stay, as long as they do not Bust

Win Condition: You have blackjack if you start with a score of 21. Blackjack gives a payout of 2.5 times your initial bet.

You can otherwise win if you have a score greater than the Dealers and less than or equal to 21. This can be done by hitting until you are as close as you are willing to go or staying at your original score. Winning this way gives a payout of 2 times your initial bet.If you bust or get less than the Dealer (without the Dealer busting) you lose your initial bet. Inputs are Chips which I gave 100 as a value. Hit is given by players to the dealer to request an extra card. Stand is to hold your total and end your turn We shuffle the deck and then player’s hand gets the cards and also dealer’s hand gets the cards. The player chips are set to the default value that is 100 If the player hand value exceeds 21 then the player busts. If the player’s hand didn’t bust until the dealer reaches 17 . Until the dealer hand value is greater than the player hand value the loop continues and the player winning stand value shows else.
