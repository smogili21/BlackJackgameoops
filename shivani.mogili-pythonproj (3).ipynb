    "Hit - You ask for an extra card.\n",

    "You are only playing against the Dealer. This means that as long as you have more than the Dealer's final score without busting, you win. The Dealer is required to hit until it gets to 17 or above.Each player can chose to Hit or Stay, as long as they do not Bust\n",
    "\n",
    "Win Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have blackjack if you start with a score of 21. Blackjack gives a payout of 2.5 times your initial bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can otherwise win if you have a score greater than the Dealers and less than or equal to 21. This can be done by hitting until you are as close as you are willing to go or staying at your original score. Winning this way gives a payout of 2 times your initial bet.\n",

    "If you bust or get less than the Dealer (without the Dealer busting) you lose your initial bet."
